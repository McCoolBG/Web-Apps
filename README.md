## ATC Phraseology Application
Collaborated with one other person to make a website that plays back audio recordings of FAA Control Tower scripts.  The app also allows the student to record their voice and listen to the audio playback of them reading the scripts.  (Had to remove the instructor audio playback when uploading.  App works best if opened with Chrome.)
